            For ten years the stargazer dreamed of taking a picture like this. The dreamer knew that the White Desert
            National Park
            in Egypt's Western Desert is a picturesque place hosting numerous chalk formations sculpted into surreal
            structures by a
            sandy wind. The dreamer knew that the sky above could be impressively dark on a clear moonless night,
            showing
            highlights
            such as the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy in impressive color and detail. So the dreamer invited an
            even
            more
            experienced astrophotographer to spend three weeks together in the desert and plan the composite images that
            needed to
            be taken and processed to create the dream image. Over three days in mid-March, the base images were taken,
            all
            with the
            same camera and from the same location. The impressive result is featured here, with the dreamer -- proudly
            wearing a
            traditional Bedouin galabyia -- pictured in the foreground.</p>

At about 100 meters from the cargo bay of the space shuttle Challenger, Bruce McCandless II was living the dream -- floating farther out than anyone had ever been before.  Guided by a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), astronaut McCandless, pictured, was floating free in space.   During Space Shuttle mission 41-B in 1984,  McCandless and fellow NASA astronaut Robert Stewart were the first to experience such an \"untethered space walk\". The MMU worked by shooting jets of nitrogen and was used to help deploy and retrieve satellites.  With a mass over 140 kilograms, an MMU is heavy on Earth, but, like everything, is weightless when drifting in orbit. The MMU was later replaced with the SAFER backpack propulsion unit.", "hdurl": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2305/freeflyer_nasa_3000.jpg", "media_type": "image", "service_version": "v1", "title": "To Fly Free in Space", "url": "https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2305/freeflyer_nasa_960.jpg" };
